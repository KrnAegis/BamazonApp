when App is loaded, you will see 10 items listed.
Each with these properties:
		id
		prod_name
		department
		quantity
		price

After app finishes listing all the items, you will be prompted with a question.
	Simply input the id matching the item you want,

Second question will be asked after an input or empty (if empty, you will not be able to continue on)
	Again, simply put a quantity of the item you want, 
	but if the item is out of stock or doesn't meet the request quantity, 
	you will have to start again

If items are in stock, the app will update the inventory and tell you your total.

Then, user will be prompted with a question to see if they wish to continue shoping.
	If yes, you can continue to buy
	If no, user will receive thank you message and you will have to restart the app to shop again.
